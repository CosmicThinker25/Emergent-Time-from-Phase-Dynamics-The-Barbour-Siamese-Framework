# Timeless Quantum Cosmology and the Siamese Phase Framework

This repository contains the full research package associated with the paper  
**“Timeless Quantum Cosmology and the Emergence of Phase Time: A Refined Barbour–Siamese Correspondence.”**

The project unifies **Barbour’s timeless quantum cosmology** with the **CPT-symmetric Siamese Phase Cosmology**, demonstrating that time emerges dynamically from a critical phase-transition mechanism. Numerical simulations reveal a robust **critical phase-mass threshold** (mφ,crit ≈ 1.965) that determines whether the Universe remains in a perfectly synchronized timeless state (Δφ = 0) or bifurcates into two CPT-conjugate emergent histories. The work also identifies a shallow rotational resonance (krot ≈ 0.33) acting as a catalyst for temporality.

This repository includes:
- Full LaTeX source of the Barbour–Siamese correspondence paper  
- The conceptual phase-portrait figure illustrating the unified framework  
- Numerical and conceptual documentation linking phase dynamics to timeless cosmology  
- **Four complete PDF versions of the paper: English, Spanish, Russian, and Chinese**, to ensure broad global accessibility  
- Zenodo archival record and citation metadata

This work provides a unified theoretical bridge between foundational philosophy of time and nonlinear cosmological dynamics, offering a mechanistic explanation for the emergence of time within a CPT-symmetric universe.
